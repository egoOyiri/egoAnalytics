egoAnalytics
============

A Clojure library designed to provide Exchange Rates for African based countries, along with Analytics Data and View to allow the conversion of Virtual Currency to Local Currencies.

# Technology Used:
A JVM based Analytics tool is required, only Incanter (written in Clojure) seems to match the R Project.
Incanter allows the data extract and writting from Files and URLs, dumping results as CSV files and diplayed by D3.JS Javascripts is the ultimate goal.
Akka Server along with Spray library will provide REST/APIs and Web Content. 


## Usage

This project uses Eclipse Counterclockwise plugin http://doc.ccw-ide.org/documentation.html
To run the sample, open up core.clj, press [CMD][ALT][S] MacOSX and [CTL][ALT][S] in Windows

At the REPL Prompt:

> (let [a (:akka/actor #(println "Received " %))]
        (:akka! a "hello")) [Ctrl+Enter]

# this project also uses Apache Spark to match  R and Incanter samples

To run the install:

> bootstrap/install.sh

HDFS_HOME=~/bin/local/bigdata/hadoop
